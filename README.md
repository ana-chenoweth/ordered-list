# Sorted List (ListaOrdenada)

This project implements a **sorted doubly-linked list** in C++. It was developed as an academic exercise to deepen the understanding of dynamic memory management and basic data structures.

The list maintains its elements in **ascending order** and includes standard operations such as:

- Inserting elements in sorted order
- Removing elements
- Searching for values
- Printing elements in ascending and descending order
- Merging two sorted lists

---

## Features

- Maintains elements sorted on insertion
- Traversal from beginning to end (ascending) or in reverse (descending)
- Exception handling for empty lists or out-of-range operations
- Merge functionality to combine two sorted lists into a new one

---

## File Structure

- `ListaOrdenada.hpp`: main class definition and interface
- `ListaOrdenada.tpp`: template method implementations
- `ListaDoble2.hpp`: supporting double-linked list class used internally
